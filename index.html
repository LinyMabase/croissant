    <h1>  Croissant</h1>
    <p> A croissant is a crescent-shaped, flaky pastry with a buttery flavor, often associated with France but with Austrian origins. It's made with a laminated dough, a technique that involves layering butter between thin sheets of dough and folding it many times to create a flaky texture. Croissants are commonly enjoyed for breakfast or as a snack, and can be eaten plain or with various fillings </p>
